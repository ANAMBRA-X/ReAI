# VERI-AI
It is a Web3-powered verification platform built on StarkNet. It helps users verify the authenticity and ownership of digital and physical assets (like certificates, land documents, or NFTs) using blockchain transparency and AI validation. Our goal is to make trust verification simple, secure, and tamper-proof.
